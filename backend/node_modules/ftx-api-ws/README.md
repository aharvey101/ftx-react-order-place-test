# ftx-api-ws

    npm install ftx-api-ws

API wrapper for the [FTX WS API](https://docs.ftx.com/#ws-api). Please refer to [their documentation](https://docs.ftx.com/#ws-api) for eveything explained. Check out `sample.js` for lib usage.

**This is a WIP**

This is a low level wrapper with zero dependencies focussed on simplicity:

- No complex code
- Only `ws` as third party lib

This is a fork based of my deribit library: https://github.com/askmike/deribit-v2-ws

## Usage

See sample.js.

## TODO

- More testing

## Final
