# Known Errors:

- [x] Position.create() doesn't return a value. This is needed to update the position when the stop is triggered

The itnention of this app is to place and manage positions, without the main strategy but with the order management rules

# TODO

- [] Stop loop after position entry, stop placed and database updated with stopOrder
- [] add functionality to update positions as needed
- [] Figure out how to get fills in
